# Session Handoff

Last updated: 2026-10-01

## Current objective

Preserve the approved light Rider visual design and complete actual geographic integration:
live vector data, foreground GPS, permission fallback, coordinate-backed search and shortcuts.
The 414 × 896 layout retains the map above y=714, Request your ride, destination shortcuts,
left hamburger, and donut menu. Booking opens in a sheet.
Pickup/drop-off placeholders use plain “Pickup address” and “Drop-off address” wording,
with no sample addresses, following the owner's latest review. Search behavior is unchanged.
The preview now centers its fictional GPS independently of booking: no automatic service-area
selection or sample pickup prefill. Its reverse lookup returns unavailable instead of verifying
a fictional street address. Restart the owner-launched preview to clear old in-memory values.
Trips, Payments, Wallet, and Account appear only after selection. Scheduling, vehicle options,
pickup notes, and ratings expand progressively. The owner has approved the design direction and
requested exact Git commands after release review. The owner performs staging, commit, and push;
Codex must not run those mutations. The changes are still local and production is unchanged.

Manual review now uses `corepack pnpm preview:rider`: a separate browser with sample Rider data
and live OpenFreeMap vector tiles. Automated checks use a simulated street grid. This is a local development harness, not an app auth bypass.
It leaves Rider's restored environment and original sign-in function unchanged, and intercepts
business requests; interactive live map tiles are allowed. Only sample fare review is supported; actual booking/payment submission
is blocked. Close the preview browser to stop its development server.

The harness smoke check passed. The agent-launched window was not visible to the owner, so that
preview was stopped. The owner should launch `node tooling/scripts/rider-preview.cjs` from their
own PowerShell session. Use the resulting dedicated window; ordinary browser tabs do not receive
the fixture interception. Rider's `.env.local` still matches its original backup and the app
sign-in function remains original.

## Authoritative checkpoint

- Local main and the recorded origin/main reference are at `86b123d`
  (`revert: restore Community checkpoint 0bdaf23`, September 7). No fetch was performed.
- The working tree was clean before Rider edits. Current changes are an uncommitted Rider UI draft,
  a display-only shared map component, local fixture browser coverage, and related documentation.
- Community files at HEAD match checkpoint `0bdaf23`. Its Capacitor runtime loads
  `https://app.community.eshapp.com`. Community Android and iOS project folders already exist.
- Earlier handoff claims about pending Community commits, passwords, invitations, and deployment
  contradicted each other. Do not treat those old checkpoints as live operational evidence.
- Community authorization, workspace separation, conversations/safety, services, public entry,
  passwordless invitations, profiles, public search, and starter information exist in repository
  history. Confirm deployed behavior separately before changing or testing their production flows.
- Latest local migration is `20260904000700_community_starter_content.sql`.
  Remote applied/pending migration state was not queried. Rider UI work adds no migration.

## Rider draft and validation

- Final release review passed: 7 browser checks, 30 Rider/maps unit tests, Rider typecheck,
  scoped lint (existing vehicle-image warning), production build, and whitespace checks. The
  review fixed pre-admission clipping; a 320 × 480 onboarding test verifies scrolling.
- Read-only remote verification confirms origin/main is still `86b123d1217b3bf7928335daeb5aa4bb3124e9d0`,
  matching local HEAD. No fetch or Git mutation occurred. Preview-generated TypeScript paths
  are excluded from the staging list; environment backups and screenshots are ignored.
- Geographic integration inspection confirmed that production already uses real Mapbox/OpenFreeMap
  vector tiles. No simulated grid, sample Rider history, or fictional GPS is imported by production.
  Those fixtures remain solely in the isolated preview/test harness.
- Search retrieval now retains and validates coordinates. Draft destination/pickup pins use them;
  recent trips reuse RLS-authorized stored booking coordinates. Legacy trips without coordinates
  ask for address selection again instead of inventing locations. Home saves a verified address
  and service area in memory for this signed-in session only, clearing on identity/provider change.
- GPS is independent of Mapbox availability. Existing grants enable foreground watches; the
  locate button explicitly requests permission otherwise. Watches stop while hidden, on identity
  changes, and at unmount. GPS denial/unavailability clears the marker and explains manual entry.
  Map gestures remain enabled; live GPS updates do not continually override the user's camera.
- Six browser checks passed: full/short viewport geometry, navigation, scheduling, GPS coordinate
  updates and map gestures, permission denial, and search/Home/recent coordinate selection.
  Maps unit suite: 15 passed; Rider unit suite: 15 passed. Production build passed; scoped lint and
  type checks passed with known baseline warnings. Browser/device GPS and search were fixtures.
- Local real-account testing remains configuration-blocked: Rider `.env.local` has no populated
  public Supabase key or Mapbox public token. Values were not printed or modified. Live tile
  rendering was verified earlier against OpenFreeMap. Physical-device/native permission lifecycle
  and actual configured Mapbox search still require manual validation with Rider's own setup.
- Latest refinement uses a generated transparent silver sedan illustration and bold 24px Request your ride text. Viewport-fit and explicit
  map/panel widths prevent a right-side strip; a ResizeObserver resizes the live canvas. The panel
  includes safe-area padding and its shortcut row remains fully visible at 414 × 896.
- Vector roads are pale blue-gray, buildings almost white with shallow sides, and street names
  are larger with white halos. Broad-area labels are hidden; small POI/transit markers remain.
  The no-token background now uses OpenFreeMap Liberty vector tiles, with individually styled
  road labels and 3m building sides. The former washed-out raster fallback has been removed.
  No token or environment change was made. Existing Mapbox routing/address contracts remain intact.
- Manual preview initializes its fictional, pre-approved GPS through the map-center action only,
  leaving booking addresses empty. Production uses actual GPS
  after permission is granted; a successful fix displays even if address resolution fails.
- Updated browser checks passed (6), including 414 × 600 viewport clipping coverage; production
  build and scoped lint passed with known existing warnings. Live vector rendering was verified
  at 414 × 896 with fictional GPS and Rider fixtures; screenshot: `test-results/rider-live-preview.png`.
  Manual preview uses its actual resizable window viewport rather than forcing a potentially
  off-screen 896px browser content area. UI sizing accounts for height as well as width.
- Home uses live Mapbox Streets, or OpenFreeMap vector tiles without a token, and a bottom Request your ride
  panel. Home uses a verified session address; recent destinations use existing book-again functionality.
  Booking appears in a focus-trapped sheet with Escape/back dismissal. The donut menu opens Request, Trips, Payments,
  Wallet, and Account with Escape dismissal and focus return.
- Provider switching and sign-out are in Account after profile creation. Onboarding remains visible.
- Fare-policy/payment disclosure and server-authoritative booking behavior remain intact.
- Scheduled trips/history remain accessible during an active ride; the CSS that hid history and
  ratings has been removed. Optional notes and vehicle/time controls expand on request.
- The map uses service-area and authorized active-trip coordinates and existing Driver refresh.
  It introduces no automatic permission prompt, location database writes, or offline caching.
- Locked dependencies were restored because the local compiler was missing; lockfile unchanged.
- Rider type check and production build passed. All 15 existing Rider unit tests passed.
- Scoped lint of Rider source, maps source, and the new browser test passed with the existing
  vehicle `img` warning. Full Rider lint is blocked by pre-existing project-service errors on
  generated native JavaScript and `public/push-sw.js`.
- The existing Google toll test fetch mock now declares `typeof fetch` so its captured request
  arguments pass TypeScript.
- Six updated UI browser fixture checks passed, including exact 414 × 896 panel/menu geometry,
  navigation, scheduling, GPS/gestures, denial, and geographic shortcuts. A screenshot check verified
  the location marker and bottom panel at y=714. Screenshots remain under ignored
  `test-results/`. Checks used dummy public Supabase configuration and intercepted preview data.
- At the owner's request, the local URL/auth troubleshooting changes have been reversed:
  `apps/rider/.env.local` was restored byte-for-byte from
  `apps/rider/.env.local.before-rider-preview`; the backup remains ignored and preserved.
- Rider's entire `sendSignInLink` function matches HEAD again, including the original browser
  redirect behavior. Native Rider URL `https://rider.eshapp.com`, the callback page, Admin code,
  and `supabase/config.toml` match HEAD. The speculative local-auth documentation and its
  callback-specific test were removed. The requested map/donut UI draft is preserved.
- The local Rider preview server was stopped so it cannot keep serving the copied configuration.
  Before resuming preview, verify Rider's own configuration with the owner; do not copy Admin
  values or change authentication based on assumptions.
- No Git mutation, deployment, hosted Auth settings change, or database mutation was performed
  by Codex. Earlier public provider lookup was read-only. Hosted redirects/templates and the live
  deployment were not verified; do not treat the earlier redirect diagnosis as established fact.
- The owner may have edited hosted redirect settings following earlier advice; their state has
  not been inspected. Do not change hosted settings during this rollback.
- Rider imports Mapbox CSS through the shared maps package, which owns the Mapbox dependency;
  this fixes stylesheet resolution with the strict pnpm installation.

## Exact next action

For real geographic/manual testing, use the normal Rider dev server with Rider's own verified
configuration, not the sample preview. Missing local public key/token must be supplied by the
owner from the correct Rider deployment before real sign-in/search tests. Do not copy Admin
configuration or change Auth URLs. Test physical-device permission, GPS movement, backgrounding,
search coordinates, session Home, and real recent trips using the operations checklist.
The isolated preview remains available for design review; its GPS/search/history are fixtures.
Release review is complete. Give the owner exact per-file staging, commit, and push commands;
production deployment/configuration verification remains the owner's responsibility. The original
environment and sign-in function remain intact. Home remains session-only.
Do not create production payments for visual review.
Codex must not stage, commit,
push, deploy, or run database mutations. Preserve the deferred native sign-in/payment-return
checkpoint and successful payment/booking record.

Review procedure: `docs/operations/rider-map-home-manual-test.md`.
Architecture: `docs/architecture/mobile-app-shell.md`.

## Repository and deployment state

The owner performs all Git mutation, deployment, and database mutation commands. Before any future
migration, the owner runs `pnpm exec supabase db push --dry-run`, confirms only intended migrations,
then performs the real push. Preserve all existing uncommitted work and use one explicit file per
staging command when the owner later requests staging instructions.

Do not submit another Community join request, manually accept an invitation, or create a production
invitation to recover context. Verify actual invitation state and product enrollment before any
future recovery; unrelated Rider/Driver or governance identity must not grant Community admission.

## Operational account note

The Resend account is registered under `ishmaelkosh@gamil.com` (email address recorded as provided).
Keep Resend API keys and all other credentials out of this handoff and out of Git.

## Deliberately deferred work

### Native Rider authentication and payment return

Mobile payment testing is paused. The Rider payment backend is functioning, verified Stripe
webhooks finalize ordinary paid bookings, and wallet-covered ordinary trips finalize directly. Do
not create another payment merely to resume investigation.

The remaining defects are native callback/session UX:

- iOS can leave the Stripe browser sheet visible after returning to Rider.
- Android can return from a magic link and refresh into a new unauthenticated WebView session even
  though the server-side booking remains intact.
- The durable follow-up is an explicit native authentication callback contract and a payment-return
  design that reliably dismisses the external browser sheet.

Preserve the successful payment/booking recovery record. Do not refund or recreate it during
callback work. A future controlled test should build Rider once for both iOS and Android after the
callback contract is implemented.

### SMS provider approval

ESH Rider SMS consent is deployed and manually validated. Consent remains separate from phone
storage, number verification, and delivery. No production SMS was sent during consent validation.

Sent compliance remains external work: finish or resubmit the public Fair Fare opt-in evidence,
then obtain the Sent API key, sender/profile, template and OTP behavior, webhook signing secret, and
10DLC approval before implementing delivery. Keep the adapter provider-neutral and Twilio
switchable; never send duplicate traffic through both providers.

Twilio verification remains paused until suspended-account billing ticket `#29018616` is resolved.
Do not retry production SMS verification before reactivation. Sent, Twilio, Meta, and other provider
credentials must not enter documentation or Git.

### Stripe sandbox dispute diagnostic

The out-of-order Stripe dispute diagnostic is deployed, but no post-deployment automatic retry was
observed. This sandbox issue is deferred and does not block ordinary payments or bookings. If work
resumes, inspect a verified automatic retry using sanitized logs only; never log signatures,
payloads, payment credentials, or secrets.

### Native notifications

Rider and Driver native release `1.0.1` was operationally validated. Web Push is deployed, but native
APNs/FCM delivery remains unimplemented. Keep Android and Apple signing credentials outside Git and
independently backed up.

### Admin control-plane cleanup

Do not remove or rename `admin.eshapp.com`. Transportation still uses it as the trusted backend
selected by `TRANSPORTATION_BACKEND_URL`. Follow
`docs/operations/admin-control-plane-safe-cleanup.md`: finish the rollback observation window,
retire only legacy product UI routes, prove a stable replacement backend, repoint every consumer,
and only then consider a domain change.

## Durable architecture boundaries

- Shared identity and infrastructure do not imply shared product admission.
- Product access requires an active tenant relationship, enabled and entitled product workspace,
  explicit enrollment, explicit product role, enabled capability, and the expected
  server-authoritative operational session.
- Rider and Driver business identities do not grant Community access.
- Branding, domains, and public configuration are not authorization.
- Community normal publishing, official publication, moderation, emergency publication, and mass
  broadcast authority remain separate permissions.
- Direct client writes stay denied where controlled RPCs enforce reason, audit, lifecycle, or
  authorization contracts.
- Preserve tenant isolation, RLS, audit evidence, notification idempotency, and exclusive product
  sessions in every follow-up.

## Production-test hygiene

- Use clearly identifiable test data.
- Do not manually accept invitations or rewrite successful payment lifecycle records.
- Cancel unfinished test bookings.
- Return test Drivers to Offline.
- Restore temporary tenant settings and notification preferences.
- Confirm no test booking remains `requested`, `offered`, `accepted`, `arrived`, or `in_progress`.
- Never approve a fare adjustment produced by unrealistic simulated GPS movement.

## Required reading for recovery

Read these before changing the current Community flow:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/roadmap.md`
- `docs/architecture/community-platform.md`
- `docs/architecture/community-platform-migration-plan.md`
- `docs/adr/0002-separate-product-applications-shared-platform.md`
- `docs/operations/admin-control-plane-safe-cleanup.md`

For work in another domain, read the matching architecture document and production manual test under
`docs/architecture/` and `docs/operations/` before implementation. Git history and migration files
remain the source of implementation evidence when older prose is stale.
