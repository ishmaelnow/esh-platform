# Session Handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-10

## Current objective

Complete Trip Pricing V1 implementation and validation on the deployed Ledger Foundation.

## Repository and deployment state

- Branch: `main`
- Admin session stabilization is deployed and passed production testing. DFW Metroplex and
  Philadelphia service areas were created successfully; Realtime Driver Location passed its live
  production test.
- Live Trip Maps commit `bba70b8`, regional geocoding commit `7b3dcd9`, pre-booking validation commit
  `a3f9ccb`, and migrations through `20260809000200_rider_geocoding_context.sql` are pushed and
  deployed. `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is required in all three Vercel projects.
- Atomic Rider booking/geocoding commit `7ed2442`, regional autocomplete commit `7973e26`, and
  migration `20260810000100_atomic_rider_geocoded_booking.sql` are deployed.
- Automatic Driver Matching commit `72c3f93` is deployed; production manual testing passed.
- Realtime Driver Location commit `7121a36` and migration
  `20260801001300_realtime_driver_location.sql` are deployed to production.
- Trigger hotfix commit `6da5ba0` and migration
  `20260802000100_fix_location_stop_triggers.sql` are deployed; Rider booking creation retest passed.
- Confirm migration state with a dry run rather than assuming it from this handoff.
- Reputation V1 commit `e87655e`, Rider layout fix `75505f7`, and migration
  `20260810000200_trip_reputation.sql` are pushed and deployed.
- Ledger commits through `e54a1b3` and migrations through
  `20260811000200_fix_ledger_currency_summary.sql` are deployed.
- Trip Pricing V1 is implemented locally in migration `20260811000300_trip_pricing_v1.sql`; it is
  not committed, applied, or production tested.

## Delivered capabilities relevant to the test

- Verified Rider email access and tenant-scoped Rider profiles.
- Ride-now self-service booking and cancellation.
- Manual Admin Dispatch and Driver trip lifecycle.
- Driver offer deadlines, expiration recovery, alerts, and email.
- Rider lifecycle emails and Rider-controlled trip-email preference.
- Tenant-time-zone scheduled pickup selection.
- Tenant-controlled minimum notice, maximum advance window, dispatch lead, and reminder lead.
- Scheduled bookings remain unavailable to drivers until dispatch activation.
- Database-native one-minute scheduled activation using `pg_cron`.
- Scheduled confirmation, reminder, and dispatch-started Rider emails.

## Current test checkpoint

Live Trip Maps, Routing, and ETA passed production manual testing across Rider, Driver, and Admin.
The successful Philadelphia trip normalized both selected addresses and initially rendered a
plausible 28-minute, 15-mile road route. Driver acceptance, shared-map parity, consented live Driver
marker, refreshed ETA, authorized Rider/Admin visibility, explicit stop-sharing, marker removal, and
saved-route persistence all passed.

Regional autocomplete, required suggestion selection, permanent re-geocoding, atomic booking and
coordinate persistence, and rejection of invalid/mapless booking creation are deployed. Mapping
tests pass 9/9; maps and Rider lint/typechecks plus the Rider production build passed before release.

Reputation V1 has role-derived Rider and Driver submission RPCs, a 30-day submission window,
seven-day/both-submitted disclosure, tenant RLS, audited Admin moderation, and Rider, Driver, and
Admin UI. Production manual testing passed, including the corrected Rider layout and Driver rating
submission experience.

## Temporary production settings

The test plan recommends temporarily using:

- Minimum notice: 15 minutes
- Maximum advance window: 90 days, or temporarily 1 day for boundary testing
- Dispatch lead: 5 minutes
- Reminder lead: 1 hour

These values are recommendations, not a confirmed statement of current production configuration.
Record the actual values here when the owner reports them.

## Confirmed recent production results

- Rider production portal loads at `https://rider.eshapp.com`.
- Existing Rider identity was recovered successfully in another browser when the magic link was
  requested and opened in that same browser.
- Continued-search Rider email was automatically delivered after an unresolved Driver offer.
- Rider Trip Notifications manual verification produced successful results before scheduled
  booking testing began.

## Known operational detail

Supabase PKCE magic-link exchange must be completed in the same browser/device that initiated that
specific sign-in attempt. The Rider account is portable, but each new browser must request and open
its own link in that browser. Email-app embedded browsers and link scanners can consume or disrupt
one-time links.

## Open issues

Ledger currency-summary and signed-zero fixes are deployed. Trip Pricing typechecks pass across
Rider, Driver, Admin, Maps, and Supabase. Maps tests pass 10/10, Admin tests pass 52/52, Rider,
Driver, and Admin lint pass, all three production builds pass, and `git diff --check` passes. The
required dry run lists only `20260811000300_trip_pricing_v1.sql`. Existing Next/Supabase dynamic
dependency and ESLint-plugin warnings remain non-blocking.

## Cleanup still required after testing

- Cancel unfinished test bookings.
- Return test Drivers to Offline.
- Restore the tenant's intended scheduling settings.
- Re-enable Rider trip emails if disabled during preference testing.
- Confirm no test booking remains `requested`, `offered`, `accepted`, `arrived`, or `in_progress`.

## Exact next action

Owner stages, commits, and pushes Trip Pricing V1, confirms `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is configured
as a server-only Rider deployment secret, applies the migration, and follows
`docs/operations/trip-pricing-manual-test.md`.
