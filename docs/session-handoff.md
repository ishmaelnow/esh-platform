# Session Handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-12

## Current objective

Complete Driver Earnings and Wallet V1 on the deployed Trip Pricing and Ledger Foundation.

## Repository and deployment state

- Branch: `main`
- Admin session stabilization is deployed and passed production testing. DFW Metroplex and
  Philadelphia service areas were created successfully; Realtime Driver Location passed its live
  production test.
- Live Trip Maps commit `bba70b8`, regional geocoding commit `7b3dcd9`, pre-booking validation commit
  `a3f9ccb`, and migrations through `20260809000200_rider_geocoding_context.sql` are pushed and
  deployed. `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is required in all three Vercel projects.
- Atomic Rider booking/geocoding commit `7ed2442`, regional autocomplete commit `7973e26`, and
  migration `20260810000100_atomic_rider_geocoded_booking.sql` are deployed.
- Automatic Driver Matching commit `72c3f93` is deployed; production manual testing passed.
- Realtime Driver Location commit `7121a36` and migration
  `20260801001300_realtime_driver_location.sql` are deployed to production.
- Trigger hotfix commit `6da5ba0` and migration
  `20260802000100_fix_location_stop_triggers.sql` are deployed; Rider booking creation retest passed.
- Confirm migration state with a dry run rather than assuming it from this handoff.
- Reputation V1 commit `e87655e`, Rider layout fix `75505f7`, and migration
  `20260810000200_trip_reputation.sql` are pushed and deployed.
- Ledger commits through `e54a1b3` and migrations through
  `20260811000200_fix_ledger_currency_summary.sql` are deployed.
- Trip Pricing V1 and completed-fare ledger fixes are deployed through commit `eed38f6`; production
  booking, lifecycle completion, and the $48.94 Rider fare display passed.
- Driver Earnings and Wallet V1 is implemented locally in
  `20260812000100_driver_earnings_wallet_v1.sql`; it is not committed or deployed.

## Delivered capabilities relevant to the test

- Verified Rider email access and tenant-scoped Rider profiles.
- Ride-now self-service booking and cancellation.
- Manual Admin Dispatch and Driver trip lifecycle.
- Driver offer deadlines, expiration recovery, alerts, and email.
- Rider lifecycle emails and Rider-controlled trip-email preference.
- Tenant-time-zone scheduled pickup selection.
- Tenant-controlled minimum notice, maximum advance window, dispatch lead, and reminder lead.
- Scheduled bookings remain unavailable to drivers until dispatch activation.
- Database-native one-minute scheduled activation using `pg_cron`.
- Scheduled confirmation, reminder, and dispatch-started Rider emails.

## Current test checkpoint

Live Trip Maps, Routing, and ETA passed production manual testing across Rider, Driver, and Admin.
The successful Philadelphia trip normalized both selected addresses and initially rendered a
plausible 28-minute, 15-mile road route. Driver acceptance, shared-map parity, consented live Driver
marker, refreshed ETA, authorized Rider/Admin visibility, explicit stop-sharing, marker removal, and
saved-route persistence all passed.

Regional autocomplete, required suggestion selection, permanent re-geocoding, atomic booking and
coordinate persistence, and rejection of invalid/mapless booking creation are deployed. Mapping
tests pass 9/9; maps and Rider lint/typechecks plus the Rider production build passed before release.

Reputation V1 has role-derived Rider and Driver submission RPCs, a 30-day submission window,
seven-day/both-submitted disclosure, tenant RLS, audited Admin moderation, and Rider, Driver, and
Admin UI. Production manual testing passed, including the corrected Rider layout and Driver rating
submission experience.

## Temporary production settings

The test plan recommends temporarily using:

- Minimum notice: 15 minutes
- Maximum advance window: 90 days, or temporarily 1 day for boundary testing
- Dispatch lead: 5 minutes
- Reminder lead: 1 hour

These values are recommendations, not a confirmed statement of current production configuration.
Record the actual values here when the owner reports them.

## Confirmed recent production results

- Rider production portal loads at `https://rider.eshapp.com`.
- Existing Rider identity was recovered successfully in another browser when the magic link was
  requested and opened in that same browser.
- Continued-search Rider email was automatically delivered after an unresolved Driver offer.
- Rider Trip Notifications manual verification produced successful results before scheduled
  booking testing began.

## Known operational detail

Supabase PKCE magic-link exchange must be completed in the same browser/device that initiated that
specific sign-in attempt. The Rider account is portable, but each new browser must request and open
its own link in that browser. Email-app embedded browsers and link scanners can consume or disrupt
one-time links.

## Open issues

Driver Earnings and Wallet V1 needs owner commit/deployment and production manual testing. The
migration defaults tenants to an 80% Driver share, locks each
completed trip split, creates a per-Driver payable account, and backfills existing completed priced
trips with an immutable reclassification. Payment collection and bank payouts remain deferred, so
the wallet correctly labels earnings pending and shows available/paid as zero. Supabase, Driver,
and Admin typechecks pass; Driver and Admin lint pass; Admin tests pass 52/52; both production builds
pass; `git diff --check` passes. The required Supabase dry-run lists only
`20260812000100_driver_earnings_wallet_v1.sql`. Existing Next/Supabase dynamic dependency and
ESLint-plugin warnings remain non-blocking.
The owner's first production migration attempt stopped transactionally during function creation
because literal percent signs in a PL/pgSQL `RAISE` message were not escaped. The local migration
now uses `%%`; the corrected dry-run again lists only the Driver wallet migration. The correction is
not committed or pushed yet, and the migration remains unapplied.

The corrected migration was subsequently committed as `b2c31d6`, deployed successfully, and its
historical backfill plus new-trip allocation passed production testing. The Driver wallet shows
$85.57 across three trips ($8.00, $38.42, and $39.15), exactly matching the Driver-specific payable
account. Admin Ledger is balanced, but its UI incorrectly warns when there are more than exactly five
accounts. A local fix now validates presence of the five required foundation account codes while
allowing Driver-specific payable accounts; it is not committed or deployed.
Admin typecheck and lint pass, the expanded Admin suite passes 54/54, and `git diff --check` passes.

## Cleanup still required after testing

- Cancel unfinished test bookings.
- Return test Drivers to Offline.
- Restore the tenant's intended scheduling settings.
- Re-enable Rider trip emails if disabled during preference testing.
- Confirm no test booking remains `requested`, `offered`, `accepted`, `arrived`, or `in_progress`.

## Exact next action

Finish validating the Admin Ledger warning fix, then owner commits and pushes it and confirms the
false warning disappears while all six valid accounts remain visible.
